# Introduction Generics
Oh no the trainee is back. Again :cry: 
He said his implementation of the `Geometrics` helper class was so great that he did a rollback.

Now it is time to prove him wrong (once again). 

---
**Task:** Rewrite the class as abstract as possible and use generics to do calculations with different data types.
Try your implementation also with wrapper classes.

Moreover you **must use** an object oriented approach. Create as many (useful) classes as you like.
